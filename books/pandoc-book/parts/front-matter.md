Explain a bit about the journey

# Acknowledgments {-}

It has a privilege to write this book and help you learn Pandoc.
Thank you for reading :)

This book would not have been possible without the support of
my wife, my son, and family and friends. They have given me
the most precious gift for a writer: some time alone to focus
and finish the book.

Finally, I would like to thank the Opensource.com team for reviewing
the articles and for their open clause that permits everyone
to continue creating knowledge. I am a strong believer in
free education and distribution of knowledge.

# About this book {-}

## Who should read this book {-}

This series is designed to help developers to produce documentation
in multiple formats from a single markup language (in this series Markdown).
We will show this using Pandoc.

In this first part of the Pandoc series I will guide you through the
installation process (briefly), show examples (that I have used in my lectures
at Uppsala University, Sweden) and we will end up with tips on how to write
documentation that is easy to port to other formats.  To do this last part, I
will argue about why the use of meta-information files creates a separation of
concerns between the content and the meta-information[^meta] of your
documentation.


[^meta]: Meta-information refers to the authors name, template used,
    bibliographic style, etc.
