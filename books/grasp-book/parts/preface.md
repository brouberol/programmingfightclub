# Preface

<p class="para"><span class="dropcaps">D</span>uring his studies at his home
university in Malaga (Spain), Kiko Fernandez-Reyes thought he knew what software
design is. Then he worked for a few years in industry and realised that code ends
up in a non-maintainable ball of spaghetti code.</p>

After his experience in industry, he went back to school to pursue doctoral studies.
During his doctoral studies, he became teacher assistant (TA) of the course Advanced
Software Design. Only then, he realised the difference between design and implementation.
After two years as TA, he became the main lecturer of the course.

Nowadays, he continues teaching students the difference between design and
implementation. This book is his legacy to all the students he has ever met.
