# Preface

<p class="para"><span class="dropcaps">D</span>uring his studies at his home university in Malaga (Spain),
Kiko Fernandez-Reyes thought he knew what a software design is.
Then he worked for a few years in industry and realised that code tends
to end up in a non-maintanable ball of spaguetti really quickly.</p>

After working in industry he decided to go back to school to pursue doctoral studies.
During his doctoral studies, he became teacher assistant (TA) of the course
Advanced Software Design and, only then, he realised the difference between
design and implementation. After two years as TA, he became main lecturer of the
course.

Nowadays, he continues teaching students the difference between
design and implementation. This book is his legacy to all the students he has ever met.
