# Preface

<p class="para"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his book shows how to write flexible
 and maintainable code. The book is not a definitive guide to any programming language
but a starting point to writing better software. To do this, we place especial emphasis
 on the type system of your language. Static and dynamic type systems bring different
benefits and drawbacks, so all examples are written in Java 8 and Python 3.4. After
 reading this book, you will be able to take an informed decision before hacking on
 your next project.</p>

The book is directed to young software engineers, developers and self-taught programmers
familiar with object-oriented programming but seeking on improving the code they write.

Part I starts with a reminder of type systems, basic concepts of object-oriented
programming and introduces UML notation. Part II introduces a case study, explains
GRASP principles and compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of the
type systems. Next, Part III analyses real world, open source projects and localises
the points where GRASP principles were used. Finally, Part IV contains solutions to
the exercises proposed throughout the book.
