# About this book

## Who should read this book

<p class="para"><span class="dropcaps">B</span>efore creating a complex software
system one needs to lay down a solid foundation.
General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles (GRASP) are guidelines to assign
reponsibilities to software classes in object-oriented programming.</p>

Unfortunately, many resources for learning these principles do not consider
the role of the type system and the programming language. To mitigate this problem,
this book explores how the type system influences the way in which
one can write these programming principles.

Static and dynamic languages bring different benefits and drawbacks,
so all examples in this book are written in Java 8 and Python 3.4.

The book primarily targets young software engineers, developers and self-taught programmers
familiar with object-oriented programming but seeking on improving the code they write.
It is of special interest to programmers who want to understand the difference
when writing clean code in a static and dynamic language.
After reading this book, you will be able to apply GRASP principles in
static and dynamic languages and make an informed decision before hacking on
your next project.

## What this book is not

This book shows how to write flexible and maintainable code through GRASP principles.
However, it is not a definitive guide to any programming language but a starting point
to writing better software. The book puts special emphasis on the language of choice,
whether it is a dynamic or static language.


## How is this book organised: A roadmap

*GRASP principles for the Object-oriented mind* gradually explains the concepts
needed to write GRASP principles in any object-oriented language. It is a beginner's
guide to design better object-oriented code and helps you to create a solid
foundation.

* [Unit 1](/grasp-principles/introduction/) highlights the common problems in todays IT industry: new concepts
do not mean silver bullets to fixing all problems with your software.

* [Unit 2](/grasp-principles/type-systems/) starts with a reminder of the different kinds of type systems, and finishes
with a comparison between them.

* [Unit 3](/grasp-principles/recap/) introduces the Unified Modelling Language (UML), its importance and
its syntactic notation. This notation will be used throughout the book together
with the code examples.

* Unit 4 explains common concepts in object-oriented programming: inheritance,
mixins and static classes among others.

* [Unit 5](/grasp-principles/case-study/) describes a case study that will be
used in the explanation of GRASP principles.

* Unit 6 explains and demonstrates how GRASP principles are applied in different
programming languages.

* Unit 7 and 8 analyses open source projects, finding points where GRASP principles
have been applied and where they should have been applied.

* Unit 9 gives solutions to exercises introduced in each unit.
