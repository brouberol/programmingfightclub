# About this book {-}

### Who should read this book {-}

<p class="para"><span class="dropcaps">B</span>efore creating a complex software system one
needs to lie down a solid foundation. General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles
(GRASP) are guidelines to assign responsibilities to software classes in object-oriented
programming.</p>

Unfortunately, many resources for learning these principles do not consider the role of the
type system and the programming language. To mitigate this problem, this book explores how the
type system influences how one can write these programming principles. Since static and dynamic
languages bring different benefits and drawbacks, this book contains examples in Java 8 and
Python 3.4.

The book targets young software engineers, developers and self-taught programmers familiar with
object-oriented programming but seeking on improving the code they write. It is also
interesting to programmers who want to understand the difference when writing clean code in a
static and dynamic language.

After reading this book you will be able to apply GRASP principles in static and dynamic
languages and make an informed decision before hacking on your next project.

### What this book is not {-}

This book shows how to write flexible and maintainable code through GRASP principles.
However, it is not a definitive guide to any programming language but a starting point to
writing better software. The book puts special emphasis on the language of choice whether it is
a dynamic or static language.

### How is this book organised: A roadmap {-}

GRASP principles for the Object-oriented mind gradually explains the concepts needed to write
GRASP principles in any object-oriented language. It is a beginner’s guide to design better
object-oriented code and helps you to create a solid foundation.

* [Unit 1](WEB/grasp-principles/introduction/)
highlights the common problems in today’s IT industry: new concepts are not
silver bullets that fix all problems with your software.

* [Unit 2](WEB/grasp-principles/type-systems/)
starts with a reminder of the different type systems, and finishes with
a comparison between them.

* [Unit 3](WEB/grasp-principles/recap/) introduces the Unified Modelling Language (UML),
its importance and its syntactic notation. The book will use this notation in all examples
together with its code.

* Unit 4 explains common concepts in object-oriented programming: inheritance, mixins and static classes among others.

* [Unit 5](WEB/grasp-principles/case-study/) describes the case study used in the next chapter.

* Unit 6 explains and shows how GRASP principles are applied in different programming languages.

* Unit 7 and 8 analyses open source projects, finding points where GRASP principles are applied and where they should have been applied.

* Unit 9 gives solutions to exercises introduced in each unit.
