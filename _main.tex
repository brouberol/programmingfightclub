\section{Prologue}\label{prologue}

This book was originally written for the course Advanced Software
Design, imparted at Uppsala University by Kiko Fernandez-Reyes, and
provides a practical hands-on experience on software design. It extends
the content of the course with a direct application of design patterns
and software principles in the object-oriented paradigm, exploiting the
type system.

\subsection{Who is this book for?}\label{who-is-this-book-for}

This book is directed to students of any computer science major, young
developers, engineers or programmers who have already grasped the idea
behind object-oriented programming.

The reader should already be familiar with the following concepts from
object-oriented programming:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Classes,
\item
  objects,
\item
  inheritance,
\item
  interfaces,
\item
  abstract classes,
\item
  parametric classes
\item
  mixins and traits
\item
  lambdas and closures
\end{itemize}

\emph{Lambdas} and \emph{closures} belong to functional programming but
they have become ubiquitous in the object-oriented paradigm too.

For those in need of a quick reminder, I have included a recap chapter
that summarises these concepts. If you are not familiar with
object-oriented programming, you should first understand the ideas
behind this paradigms and come back later to this book.

\subsection{What is covered in this
book?}\label{what-is-covered-in-this-book}

This book covers most of the design principles and design patterns used
today in industry, necessary for building \emph{maintainable} and
\emph{flexible} applications. All the principles and design patterns are
written in two languages: Java and Python. These languages are already
used in production in big companies and are well established. For
instance, Pinterest uses Python for their backend operations and Java is
widely used everywhere.

The mix of these two languages covers two different type systems: static
and dynamic.

\textbf{Why multiple languages?}

Each language has its strengths and weaknesses. In this book, I show how
to apply the same design pattern by fully exploiting the main strengths
of each language. In a typed language, you use polymorphism to guarantee
that the object that you interact with satisfies its expected behaviour,
while in an untyped system you exchange freedom from the safety (and
sometimes rigidity) of a type system.

Choosing a language is \emph{already} an important \emph{design
decision} as languages are tied to a paradigm and a type system, and
these cannot be changed. For this reason, it's important to evaluate the
language features and what the type system buys for us. For example: -
Is it a pain to use the command pattern in Java using lambda notation? -
Is Python (and its untyped nature) the best way to go to write large
code bases that are resilient to change?

In this book, we do not provide an absolute truth nor do we try to do
so; we show that static and dynamic type systems have inherent benefits
and drawbacks. You have to work through the examples and exercises to
find your own truth and comfort zone.

\subsection{Organisation}\label{organisation}

The book is organised in 4 parts. The first part (chapters 1 and 2) puts
in perspective what is software design, why design patterns are
important and described the case study that we are going to build and
refer to throughout the book. The second part introduces software
principles to create flexible and maintainable software, known as GRASP
and SOLID principles. Part 3 explains, in depth, core design patterns
that are grouped into 3 categories: \emph{creational}, \emph{structural}
and \emph{behavioural} patterns. The last part builds a Web application
using most of the patterns presented in this book.

For each design pattern, there is a clear and concise explanation of the
design pattern (sometimes illustrating a simple simile from the real
world), its benefits and drawbacks. Afterwards, the pattern is
explained, we include easy to grasp examples to get you familiar with
the language and the design pattern. As mentioned above, for a full
example that combines software principles and patterns, you should refer
to the last chapter.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

You worked really hard for over a year in the next billion dollar web
app in a small startup: the CEO, Johan, seems happy that the product is
(almost) feature complete, the designer, Anders, is happy with the UX
and graphics and the CTO, Pontus, just wants to press the red button and
release the product. You tell them to wait 10 more minutes, the unit
tests, integration tests and system tests are still running (adding
tests was a long battle with everyone because it slowed down the project
quite a lot, but you are a good engineer and tests will catch many
errors now and in the future).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ding, ding, ding (sound)
\end{itemize}

You look at the screen, all 142 tests are green! You tell Pontus to push
the red button; deployment scripts start, your software is being
installed on all the AWS servers the company could afford, a few
database servers with replication for faster reads and a single leader
for the writes, load balancers, reverse proxy servers for serving static
data and another bunch of servers running your application. After a few
minutes, the deployment is a success, your baby is ALIVE and by tomorrow
morning your product will be featured in all the Swedish newspapers (you
live in Stockholm, the European capital for startups).

The next day comes, you try the webapp and observe that the system is
just f****** slow. It seems that connections time out and you observe in
your monitoring tools that the server is not processing that many
requests. What the hell is going on!?

The CTO has the intuition that it could be related to that lock that was
introduced for the concurrent writes to the database and it may be as
simple as releasing the lock. If his intuition is right, you'll fix the
code, add the test that should have covered that case and be presto in 5
min to re-deploy the application.

There is one problem though, the code doesn't have a well defined
structure and the lock somehow was passed inside a lambda -- you had to
try out lambdas in Java, they are cool -- so you have no way to
releasing the lock directly. More over, you are passing a bunch of
lambdas and there's no easy way to tell which one has the damn lock!
Shit, if only you knew when made sense to use lambdas and all the cool
features of the language! .

\subsubsection{How did you end up in this
situation?}\label{how-did-you-end-up-in-this-situation}

You coded a system considering all the functional requirements and the
architecture but you failed to create a good design. The hype of new
features seemed like a silver bullet and everyone is using them (same
thing happens with new frameworks all the time). The problem is
understanding when to use those shiny new features and how they affect
your design.

\subsubsection{Software Design in this
book}\label{software-design-in-this-book}

Many books explain software design with focus on one language and assume
that this knowledge can be ``easily'' extrapolated to other languages
and/or paradigms. While it is true that you have to start from
somewhere, it is also true that as soon as try to put design patterns
into practice in another language their explanations may not be easy to
follow or may not even make sense, from the language's perspective.

\includegraphics{https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png} (image
from \url{https://xkcd.com/1513/})

Our approach in this book is much more practical and can only be
extrapolated to other languages once there is a common understanding of
how the type system interplays with the most common software design
patterns.

For this reason, we are going to cover design patterns from the
perspective of different languages and type systems, and we are going to
show different approaches to solving the same problem. You will learn to
take advantage of each of the language constructs, when to use them and
when avoid them.

Before we start, let's do a recap on what software design means.

\subsection{Software Design}\label{software-design}

Software design is the process of finding a satisfactory solution to a
problem.

Before one can start with an implementation there needs to be a clear
specification of the problem to solve and a good understanding of the
domain of the system under design (you can draw a domain model to
clarify ideas). You can also write an informal document that describes
the steps necessary to solve the problem (class and sequence diagrams
can help here) and notes about the expected non-functional requirements,
i.e., importing your friends' favourite places cannot block the main
thread and should finish in less than 30 seconds.

\subsubsection{Connecting the dots with agile
methodologies}\label{connecting-the-dots-with-agile-methodologies}

Given the definition above, designing software seems to be completely
disjoint from agile methodologies, e.g.~Scrum, where you break user
stories into smaller tasks until everything is clear to the whole team.
In Scrum there seems to be no domain model, not a single static and/or
behavioural diagram, no architecture, etc, just code-what-the-post-it
says. There is one problem if this approach is taken literally though:
the post-it tells you what the problem is but not how to design it! You,
as a software engineer, should look at domain modelling, static and
behaviour models and architectural diagrams as tools under your belt
that may be used if required, even in agile methodologies.

Software design is all about making decisions.

Every problem involves taking small and big decisions and these
influence the final outcome of your software. For instance, the
``simple'' task of choosing a programming language has a tremendous
impact on your software. Choose a dynamic language and you'll find quite
a lot of errors at runtime (even if you use a test-driven development
approach). Other example is choosing between a object-oriented or a
functional language. You can always write the same piece of software
using one paradigm or the other. However, one of them will bring
inherent benefits while the other one puts some extra burden in your
code.

\includegraphics{https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality_2.png} (Image
from \url{http://xkcd.com/1695/})

\subsubsection{What is a good design?}\label{what-is-a-good-design}

In general, a good design is one that can deal with change.

A software engineer has to think much more abstract than other
engineers, e.g.~civil engineer. For instance, as a civil engineer, you
may have to think about building a bridge that can stand X number of
tons and, under any circumstance fall down. As a software engineer, you
have to think about a piece of code that today is a car, tomorrow is a
submarine and the next day is a tank and this happens because it is just
code, anyone can update it and it is not set in stone, ever.

There are many ways to solve a problem and, more often than not, there
exist well-study common solutions. These well-documented solutions are
called design patterns and they exist for all kinds of paradigms. In
this book, we will focus on object-oriented design patterns.

\subsubsection{Design patterns}\label{design-patterns}

A design pattern is a well-designed solution to a common problem. Design
patterns are expressed in a concise and clear format, and they follow a
structure similar to the one below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  pattern name, so that experts can refer to a common pattern
\item
  concise and well-defined problem specification
\item
  unequivocal solution
\item
  trade-offs of the pattern
\end{itemize}

In this book, we follow this structure together with auxiliary UML class
diagrams (explained in later chapters).

\section{Recap}\label{recap}

This section covers basic concepts from the object oriented and
functional paradigms. More conretely, by the end of the chapter you
should be familiar with the following concepts from object-oriented
programming in Java and Python:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Classes,
\item
  objects,
\item
  inheritance,
\item
  interfaces,
\item
  mixins and traits,
\item
  abstract classes and
\item
  parametric classes
\end{itemize}

and the following concepts from functional programming in Clojure and
Haskell:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Anonymous functions / lambdas,
\item
  high-order functions,
\item
  parametric functions,
\item
  algebraic data types,
\item
  multi-functions
\item
  immutability
\item
  recursion
\end{itemize}

Keep in mind that some languages have features that do not exist in
other languages. For instance, algebraic data types exist in Haskell but
not in Clojure and parametric classes exist in Java but not in Python.
In the former case, algebraic data types cannot be fully build in
Clojure due to its dynamic typing nature -- Clojure cannot typecheck the
difference between data types and data values (we'll explain what this
means later on). In the latter case, parametric functions do not make
sense for Python due to, again, its dynamic nature. If you got the
feeling that this does not make sense and you cannot follow, everything
will be explain with examples soon, when we cover these basic concepts.
Let's begin!

\subsection{Object-oriented concepts}\label{object-oriented-concepts}

The concepts covered in this section are shown in Java and Python.

\emph{Note: Clojure is an impure language that mixes the functional
programming concepts with the object-oriented paradigm. In the remaning
chapters, we omit using the object-oriented capabilities of Clojure,
since the objective is to learn the main benefits that each language
brings to the table.}

\hypertarget{classes}{\subsubsection{Classes}\label{classes}}

Classes describe the state and behaviour of an object. The state of a
class lives in its attributes while the behaviour is expressed via its
methods. A class that hides its attributes with a \texttt{private}
access modifier (remember \texttt{public}, \texttt{protected} and
\texttt{private}?) protects its internal state from other classes. Now,
the only way to update the internal state is via method calls
(\textbf{they represent the behaviour of the object}). As a general
advice, you should not expose the internal state of your class to
others; you should expose your behaviour. This is what makes
abstractions great, trust on my behaviour and not on my internal
structure. My favorite abstractions are tasks and futures and they hide
the internal details of spawning a new thread.

Classes expose their behaviour via its methods. If those methods just
get the attributes and set them, we call them \emph{getters} and
\emph{setters}.

That's enough for an introduction to something that should you already
now, let's see some code! Let's start with a typical example and work on
it:

Idea: Let's model a dog, who has as state her alertness and her
behaviour is to bark only when she is startled. As owner, you can check
if the dog is startled or relaxed.

\textbf{Java}

The class \texttt{Dog} has as state a \emph{private} attribute
\texttt{alert}. (the attribute is not accesible from outside the class).
The constructor of the class (\texttt{public\ Dog()}) creates a new
\texttt{Dog} and sets its state to some default value. To get the state
outside the class we use \emph{getters} and \emph{setters} methods.
These are preceded by the words \texttt{get} and \texttt{set} following
the attributes name, e.g. \texttt{getAlert}. This is represented in the
Example 3.1.1.1.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Dog \{}
  \CommentTok{// state of the Dog}
  \KeywordTok{private} \DataTypeTok{boolean} \NormalTok{alert;}

  \CommentTok{// constructor}
  \KeywordTok{public} \FunctionTok{Dog}\NormalTok{()\{}
    \KeywordTok{this}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{alert} \NormalTok{= }\KeywordTok{false}\NormalTok{;}
  \NormalTok{\}}

  \CommentTok{// getter method}
  \KeywordTok{public} \DataTypeTok{boolean} \FunctionTok{getAlert}\NormalTok{()\{}
    \KeywordTok{return} \KeywordTok{this}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{alert}\NormalTok{;}
  \NormalTok{\}}

  \CommentTok{// setter method}
  \KeywordTok{public} \DataTypeTok{void} \FunctionTok{setAlert}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{boolean} \NormalTok{newAlert)\{}
    \KeywordTok{this}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{alert} \NormalTok{= newAlert;}
  \NormalTok{\}}

  \CommentTok{// behaviour}
  \KeywordTok{public} \DataTypeTok{void} \FunctionTok{bark}\NormalTok{()\{}
    \KeywordTok{if} \NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{this}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{alert}\NormalTok{) \{}
      \BuiltInTok{System}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{out}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{println}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Woof Woof"}\NormalTok{);}
    \NormalTok{\}}
  \NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Example 3.1.1.1. Introductory example to Java}

\textbf{Python}

Python doesn't have access modifiers and uses (by convention) an
underscore (or two, let's now go into why) to mean that the attribute is
private. The constructor \texttt{def\ \_\_init\_\_(self,\ alert=False)}
method takes explicitly an instance of itself \texttt{self} and a
default argument, \texttt{alert} that, if it's not provided, it is set
to \texttt{False}. Before we continue disecting the constructor, let's
briefly introduce getters and setters.

Python provides a special syntax for getters and setters that wrap the
attribute into a function with that very same name. For instance, the
getter for the \texttt{alert} attribute is created by declaring a method
with the name of the attribute and the \texttt{@property} on top of it.
The body of the method just fetches the attribute.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
    \AttributeTok{@property}
    \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{alert(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
      \ControlFlowTok{return} \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.__alert}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Setters work in the same way, except that they are annotated with the
attribute's name followed by the \texttt{setter} word, e.g.
\texttt{@alert.setter} for the \texttt{alert} setter method. From now
on, when we call on \texttt{self.alert} we are actually calling the
getter method and when we assign \texttt{self.alert\ =\ True}, we are
calling the setter method.

Now, if we go back to the \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} method from Example
3.1.1.2, we can observe that this is indeed the desire behaviour.

\textbf{Why would we want to use getters and setters like that?} Young
padawan, they are an abstraction. Now you only want to retrieve the data
but, with this abstraction, you could be returning cached data that
otherwise needs to be fetched from the network. Later on, we will learn
about the decorator pattern and how it rocks in Python!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Dog:}
  \KeywordTok{def} \FunctionTok{__init__}\NormalTok{(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{, alert}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{False}\NormalTok{):}
    \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.alert }\OperatorTok{=} \NormalTok{alert}

  \AttributeTok{@property}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{alert(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
    \ControlFlowTok{return} \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.__alert}

  \AttributeTok{@alert.setter}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{alert(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{, new_alert):}
    \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.__alert }\OperatorTok{=} \NormalTok{new_alert}

  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{bark(}\VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{):}
    \ControlFlowTok{if} \VariableTok{self}\NormalTok{.alert }\KeywordTok{is} \VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{:}
      \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Woof Woof"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Example 3.1.1.2 Introductory example to Python}

\subsubsection{Objects}\label{objects}

Objects represent instances of the \protect\hyperlink{classes}{class} at
runtime. An object gets the default state defined by their constructor
and the behaviour defined from the class declaration.

\textbf{Java}

Following the example before, let's create an object:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Dog dog = }\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Dog}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This calls on the constructor of the \texttt{Dog} class that sets the
\texttt{alert} state to \texttt{false}. If the dog tries to bark nothing
will happen:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dog.}\FunctionTok{bark}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The dog barks when it is startled, let's make her bark:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dog.}\FunctionTok{setAlert}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{true}\NormalTok{);}
\NormalTok{dog.}\FunctionTok{bark}\NormalTok{();}
\CommentTok{// prints "Woof Woof"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Python}

Creation of an object is similar to Java:

To make the dog bark:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dog.bark()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

which does nothing because the dog is not startled. Let's use the setter
to change its state and make her bark:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dog.alert }\OperatorTok{=} \VariableTok{True}
\NormalTok{dog.bark()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Woof Woof
\end{verbatim}

Notice that in this case, we could have set the initial state of the dog

\NormalTok{dog.bark()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsubsection{Inheritance}\label{inheritance}

A class can inherit methods from other
\protect\hyperlink{classes}{classes}, called inheritance. The class that
inherits methods is called \emph{subclass} while the class that provides
them is called \emph{super class}. Java has single inheritance, meaning
that the subclass can inherit only from a single class while Python has
a limited form of multiple inheritance.

Idea: A computer has various levels of memory, L1, L2, Last-level cache
and main memory. In this example, the class \texttt{Computer} inherits
operations from memory, so that we can call methods that retrieve
objects from main memory. (this is an example and I would not advice any
one to create a virtual machine based on this idea)

\textbf{Java}

Since Java can only inherit from a single class, we can model the idea
above as shown in \emph{Example 3.1.3 Java inheritance}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Memory \{}

  \KeywordTok{private} \NormalTok{CacheL1 l1;}
  \KeywordTok{private} \NormalTok{CacheL2 l2;}

  \KeywordTok{public} \FunctionTok{Memory}\NormalTok{()\{}
    \DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{kilobyte = }\DecValTok{1024}\NormalTok{*}\DecValTok{1024}\NormalTok{;}
    \DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{megabyte = }\DecValTok{1024} \NormalTok{* kilobyte;}
    \KeywordTok{this}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{l1} \NormalTok{= }\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{CacheL1}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{512}\NormalTok{*kilobyte);}
    \KeywordTok{this}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{l2} \NormalTok{= }\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{CacheL2}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{*megabyte);}
  \NormalTok{\}}

  \KeywordTok{public} \BuiltInTok{Object} \FunctionTok{fetchLocation}\NormalTok{(}\BuiltInTok{Location} \NormalTok{lo) \{ }\CommentTok{// ... \}}
\NormalTok{\}}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Computer }\KeywordTok{extends} \NormalTok{Memory \{}
  \KeywordTok{public} \KeywordTok{class} \FunctionTok{Computer}\NormalTok{()\{}
    \CommentTok{// ...}
  \NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Example 3.1.3 Java inheritance}

The class \texttt{Computer} inherits the methods \texttt{Memory} when
\texttt{Computer\ extends\ Memory}. This means that we can fetch objects
from memory, \texttt{computer.fetchLocation(location);}.

\textbf{Python}

Python supports two forms of multiple inheritance, known as old-style
and new style. In the old-style form, the multiple inheritance works in
depth-first and left-to-right order. For instance:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{L1(}\BuiltInTok{object}\NormalTok{):}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{send_info():}
    \BuiltInTok{print} \StringTok{"Sending from L1 to bus"}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{L2(}\BuiltInTok{object}\NormalTok{):}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{send_info():}
    \BuiltInTok{print} \StringTok{"Sending from L2 to bus"}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Cache(L1, L2):}
  \ControlFlowTok{pass}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{CPU(}\BuiltInTok{object}\NormalTok{):}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{send_info():}
    \BuiltInTok{print} \StringTok{"Sending info from CPU to bus"}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Computer(CPU, Cache):}
  \ControlFlowTok{pass}

\NormalTok{c }\OperatorTok{=} \NormalTok{Computer()}
\NormalTok{c.send_info()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Example 3.1.3 Python old-style}

In this case, the \texttt{c.send\_info()} method prints
\texttt{Sending\ info\ from\ CPU\ to\ bus}. If we were to change the
order of the inherited classes, \texttt{class\ Computer(Cache,\ CPU)},
then the printing method would have been
\texttt{Sending\ from\ L1\ to\ bus}.

The multiple inheritance new style kicks in when classes do not inherit
from \texttt{object} (as opposed to what \texttt{L1} and \texttt{L2} do
in \emph{Example Python old-style}). The new style considers
breath-first and left-to-right order.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{L1:}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{send_info():}
    \BuiltInTok{print} \StringTok{"Sending from L1 to bus"}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{L2:}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{send_info():}
    \BuiltInTok{print} \StringTok{"Sending from L2 to bus"}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Cache(L1, L2):}
  \ControlFlowTok{pass}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{CPU:}
  \KeywordTok{def} \NormalTok{send_info():}
    \BuiltInTok{print} \StringTok{"Sending info from CPU to bus"}

\KeywordTok{class} \NormalTok{Computer(Cache, CPU):}
  \ControlFlowTok{pass}

\NormalTok{c }\OperatorTok{=} \NormalTok{Computer()}
\NormalTok{c.send_info()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Example 3.1.3 Python new style}

In \emph{Example 3.1.3 Python new style}, the \texttt{c.send\_info()}
method would have printed \texttt{Sending\ info\ from\ CPU\ to\ bus}
given that \texttt{Cache} does not provide a suitable
\texttt{send\_info} method explictly.

\hypertarget{interfaces}{\subsubsection{Interfaces}\label{interfaces}}

\textbf{TODO: missing default methods and static methods in interfaces
(they can have implementations!)}

Interfaces declare a contract of the expected behaviour of classes that
implement the interface. An interface \emph{merely} defines methods.
Classes that would like to be compatible with the interface need to
implement those methods. The real purpose of interfaces is to enable
polymorphism, e.g.~being able to call methods on different classes
because they implement the same interface. Java has interfaces but
Python completely lacks them. Dynamic languages such as Python cannot
express interfaces because they don't have a static type system, the
fact of not having static types inhibits interfaces.

\textbf{Java}

In Java an interface is declared similar to how classes are declared,
except that you use the word \texttt{interface}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{interface} \NormalTok{MemOperations \{}

  \NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\emph{Example 3.1.4 Java interfaces}

If you forget to implement one of the methods declared in the interface,
the type system will throw an error and complain that you forgot to
implement the missing methods. You won't get unexpected crashes at
runtime because the method doesn't exist.

From the \emph{Example 3.1.4 Java Interfaces} we can create different
cache levels and treat them as if they are just \texttt{MemOperations}.
Calling methods on each one prints a different \texttt{String}.

\begin{verbatim}
CacheL1 c1 = new CacheL1(512);
CacheL2 c2 = new CacheL2(2048);

ArrayList<MemOperations> a = new ArrayList<MemOperations>();
a.append(c1);
a.append(c2);

for(cache: a){
  cache.flush();
}

// prints:
// "Flushing from CacheL1"
// "Flushing from CacheL2"
\end{verbatim}

As of Java 8, interfaces can declare a \emph{default} implementation for
methods. This is great from the design point of view: you can provide a
default implementation as long as you rely only on the known behaviour
(other public methods of the interface). This means that you can create
a clean design that does not rely on internal state and/or methods.

\textbf{TODO: Template pattern fits here perfectly!}

\textbf{TODO: Should I explain polymorphism here? It's GRASP\ldots{}}

\textbf{TODO: Should I show a code example?}

\textbf{TODO: I believe I am explaining super basic stuff and should
level up\ldots{}}

\hypertarget{abstract-classes}{\subsubsection{Abstract
classes}\label{abstract-classes}}

Abstract classes can be seen as a mix between
\protect\hyperlink{interfaces}{interfaces} and
\protect\hyperlink{classes}{classes}: they can contain attributes,
define methods and declare abstract methods. Abstract methods provide a
declaration of the behaviour but not a definition (implementation). An
abstract class cannot work on its own -- cannot be instantiated alone --
and needs to be subclass by another class, which implements the abstract
methods.

\textbf{Java}

It may seem as if \protect\hyperlink{interfaces}{Interfaces} (as of Java
8) and \protect\hyperlink{abstract-classes}{Abstract Classes} serve the
same purpose. However, there is a subtle difference: an interface can
only create public methods and constant declarations (\emph{static} and
\emph{final} attributes) while an abstract class can declare and define
the internal state of the class.

As an advice, I would recommend to use interfaces whenever you have
various subclasses that need to implement the same behaviour. I would
consider the use of an abstract class in limited cases and only when
there is a need to share the same private state among objects that are
quite similar.

The following case study will be used throughout the book to teach you
important design concepts and principles. The reader exercises are also
based on this case study.

\textbf{Startup idea}

The startup you work for has this idea of building a travelling social
network: a mix of Twitter, TripAdvisor and Pinterest all in one site. To
build this idea, there will be a web server (backend) and a mobile app
(front-end). The idea is the following:

\emph{Based on your friends recommendations, you get your own personal
guides with places to visit, restaurants, hotels, etc., all based on
curated content from people you trust. These guides don't show the
typical and perfect pictures from the owner of the place, but the ones
your friends have uploaded. If there are too many pictures from your
friends, the system selects the best pictures using an AI algorithm and
shows these in the cover of the guide. The comments are limited to 200
characters, making sure recommendations go directly to the point. Future
work will allow any use to post also video comment of no more than 30
seconds.}

\emph{In the beginning, your friends may not yet be part of this
platform. To get you started with the most relevant content from your
friends, you can enable the integration with TripAdvisor and we will
import your reviews, your friends' and also photos from your friends and
people you follow.}

\emph{Another important feature is to show the location of the places
(in a guide) in a map and pinpoint exactly the distance to the place and
average time by public transport and walking time. All of these features
are meaningless unless you can use the app offline. Thus, the app should
work in offline mode and sync with the server once there is internet
connection.}

Your team works using an agile methodology, Scrum, and there are post-it
everywhere with the list of functional features (we will go through the
list of non-functional later on).

)

\textbf{Coding the information}

One way to identify classes is to look at the domain model \footnote{this
  refers to the concepts of the domain in discourse, that is, the
  entities and ideas that make up the travelling social network.}, since
the concepts from the domain need to be coded in the application. Given
the sales pitch above, you can easily identify the following concepts: -
Lodge (Hotel, apartment, etc) - Point of interest (POI) - Restaurant -
Bar - Nightclub - Person - Friend - Picture - Video - Comment - Review -
Guide - etc (enough for now)

The domain concepts represent important ideas of our domain. These will
be coded into classes that represent the data layer of our application
and contains business logic that is encapsulated within each of the
classes.

We proceed to explain object-oriented programming using examples this
domain.

\section{GRASP principles}\label{grasp-principles}

Before you learn advanced design patterns, it's useful to look at common
principles / recommendation rules to guide your design. By following
these principles, you will design and write code that's easy to
understand, maintain, and refactor.

By the end of this chapter you will have grok these principles and they
will become second nature to you. Next, we introduce these principles (
which can be applied to any object-oriented language): - low coupling, -
high cohesion, - creator, - information expert, - controller, -
polymorphism, - indirection, - pure fabrication, and - protected
variation.

There are exercises for each principle at the end of the chapter to help
you understand the difference between them.

\subsection{Low Coupling}\label{low-coupling}

This principle states that a class should only depend on the minimum and
required amount of classes, no more and no less. A low coupled class is
easy to maintain and refactor because it interacts with a minimum amount
of objects. A high coupled class has many dependencies to other objects
and has low cohesion, i. e. it is not focused, has too many
responsibilities and does too many things.

A low coupled design is easy to change and the changes do not spread
across multiple classes. In the beginning of your journey to become a
better programmer, it's difficult to acknowledge this principle until
you deal with its counterpart, a high coupled bowl of spaghetti code.
For this reason, it is much easier to spot a highly coupled design than
to identify a low coupled one.

We define coupling as any code that satisfies items in the following
list: - the class has an attribute to another object, - calls on methods
of other objects, - inherits from another class, - implements one or
more interfaces, and - inherits mixins

The reader should notice that there will always exist coupling but,
dependencies to stable items are not problematic -- standard library --
because these have been well designed and do not change often. The
problem is not coupling per se, but creating a highly coupled design to
unstable objects.

Example: (Example of high coupled design)

Better alternative is the following code:

(Example of low coupled code)

\textbf{Exercise based on case study}

\subsection{High Cohesion}\label{high-cohesion}

Cohesion refers to the property of staying focus on the responsibilities
of the class. A cohesive class does one thing and does it well. Highly
cohesive code is focused and, as side effect, doesn't talk to too many
objects.

Often you'll see code that contains many methods, attributes and seems
to contain a lot of logic and magic. From now on, please know that this
is the antipattern known as``The Blob'', result of a high coupling and
low cohesion.

(Image of the Blob)

Example of The Blob antipattern:

(Code, better if it's from a real example)

You can identify highly cohesive code if: - code doesn't mix
responsibilities, - has few methods, - doesn't talk too many objects.

\textbf{Dependence relationship}: \emph{Coupling} and \emph{cohesion}
usually go hand in hand, since code with low cohesion is code that does
too many things, hence it relies on too many objects.

One way to look at it is to understand coupling as the relation between
subsystem and cohesion as the relation within a subsystem. For instance,
the following code shows these two weaknesses in Figure X.

(Listing of high coupled and low cohesion code)

(Figure X)

These figure further shows how a change in one class affects many other
classes thus, the code becomes more complex and difficult to maintain.
If we refactor this code, it ends up as listing Yyy, Figure Yy6y.

(Listing Yyy)

(Figure Yy6y)

\textbf{Exercise}: given the following code, add the following
functionality: - feature a - feature b - feature c \emph{Reflection}: -
How many classes did you change? - does it seem like such a design is
flexible and easy to refactor?

\textbf{Exercise}: Refactor the baseline code from the above exercise to
achieve low coupling and high cohesion. Add more features a, b, and c.
\emph{Reflection}: does it seem like this design is flexible and easy to
refactor?

\subsection{Creator}\label{creator}

This principle is likely overlooked but it plays a crucial role in
object-oriented programming; the creator \emph{establishes who is
responsible} for creating an object. If you defined it well, your code
will exhibit loose coupling and high cohesion; err an you will begin
your journey to maintaining spaghetti code.

\textbf{Application}: a class \texttt{X} is the creator of an object
\texttt{Y} if any of the following statements are satisfied: - class
\texttt{X} initialises object \texttt{Y} - class \texttt{X} contains
object \texttt{Y} - class \texttt{X} closely uses and depends on class
\texttt{Y}

For instance, a point of interest (POI) has comments, hence POI is the
creator of instances of the \texttt{Comment} class.

\textbf{Exercise}: what kind of benefits and drawbacks do I get if
\texttt{POI} is not the creator of comments? Solution: if comments are
always the same, just text, then it makes sense that \texttt{POI}is the
creator. However, what if I want to support multiple kinds of comments,
i.e.~video comments, text, or images as à comment? In that case, you are
better off injecting the comments as an extra argument to the POI
object. -- does this makes sense? POI is always created first and
comments are added later on, it's not an initialiser but a method that
adds comments.

\subsection{Information Expert}\label{information-expert}

Classes have methods that define their responsibility and behaviour. A
class exposes its behaviour via methods and its internals should always
be opaque. With this basic idea, this principle helps you to identify
the behaviour of each class.

A class is responsible for a behaviour if that class contains all the
information to carry it out. For example, which object should be
responsible for updating the description of a guide? a. \texttt{User}
object b. \texttt{POI} (point of interest) object c.
\texttt{LatitudeLongitude} object d. \texttt{Guide} object

This one is easy. Lets consider each option: a. If we update the guide
description via \texttt{this.user.setGuideDescription(newDescription)}
it implies that each user has a single guide, otherwise we would not
know which guide we are updating. It could also mean that each user may
be uniquely identified by its email and its guide. This is a really bad
design from the relational point of view, database-wise. When
representing the data layer from a NoSQL database this is allowed and I
have seen it in use. I do not think this is a good model since, in the
database, each record with the the same email is treated independently.
b. A point of interest, such as a view, may be linked to multiple
guides. For this reason, similar to above, such a design is
non-maintainable. c. This really does not make sense. d. We have a
winner! The guide instance has all the information to update the guide.

The information expert assigns responsibilities to the classes that have
all the information to fulfill the action.

\textbf{Exercise}: A user wants to submit a few pictures with a review
of her favourite restaurant in Málaga, Spain. Which of the following
classes should be the information expert and provide that behaviour? a.
\texttt{User} object b. \texttt{Guide} object c. \texttt{Review} object

\subsection{Controller}\label{controller}

Controller

\subsection{Polymorphism}\label{polymorphism}

This principle is one of the most important ones in object-oriented
programming and the one that makes OOP great at dividing
responsibilities between classes.

As we saw in the recap section, this polymorphism refers to classes that
implement an interface or inherit from a top class and not to parametric
classes, which is also polymorphic on the (opaque or bounded) type
variable.

This principle allows classes to specify the same responsibilities via
an interface but decouples the behaviour for each type. For instance, in
our application, we want to show a special logo on top of the pictures
of famous users who have confirmed their identity. A valid design, that
does not scale, has a single \texttt{User} class with an attribute named
\texttt{confirmedIdentity} which sets the flag to true when the user has
confirmed its identity. This design works for 2 users, the normal and
confirmed users. Tomorrow, Johan (CEO) wants to add a new kind of user
who represents a company instead of a person, companies cannot create
accounts and they have confirmed its identity. Creating a company's
profile as a confirmed user seems wrong and error prone, it makes no
sense the attribute \texttt{confirmedIdentity} for a company's profile
because we know that this will always be true. The current code looks
like listing Xxxx.

(Listing Xxxx)

Another design choice is to represent this distinction of different
users using an enum attribute. Based on this value, the
\texttt{displayImage()} method adds logic to check which kind of user
you are and how to display the image. You go home thinking that this is
a good design, all the logic it's kept in a single method.

The problem with this approach, quite often used by beginners or as a
shortcut, is that different classes are encoded within the same single
one. This design is not maintainable in the long run because the same
class encodes behaviour for different objects. Your design is
abstracting at the wrong level.

A better approach is to create a class for each kind of user and
dispatch dynamically. This design is easier to maintain because the
behaviour is not encoded solely on the method, but on the type. The
Figure Yyy shows how to dynamically dispatch based on the type.

\textbf{Exercise} Write the code depicted on Figure Yyy.

\textbf{Exercise} Write the main class and show that the method performs
a dynamic dispatch based on the classes.

\textbf{Exercise} Write the code relying on inheritance and another
version relying on interfaces. What are the benefits and drawbacks of
the design and implementation decisions?

(Note: this is distinct for Python because there's no interface etc.
Think how would you explain it in python)

Python is a dynamic language with a weak type system. This means the
language assigns types at runtime, but you as a developer won't get any
type error at compilation time. In Python polymorphism is always given
and you as developer are in charge of ending that the methods you call
exist or you will get a runtime error. As we said, the are no interfaces
that we are bound to and python supports what's called duck typing,
which is an idea much closer to how things work in real life. Let me
show this with an example: you can read articles, news, cereal boxes and
anything that has text. In Java you are bound by the type of object you
are but in Python you are bound to the behaviour you have. A method call
on \texttt{newspaper.\ hasText()} and \texttt{cerealBox.hasText()} works
in Python independent from their type; Java would make this work only
when they belong to the sand type or interface. For this reason, Python
is more expressive in this regard, although it sacrifices static typing
guarantees and forces the developer to either handle exceptions or crash
and burn at runtime if the object on which the program calls the method
\texttt{hasText()} does not provide such behaviour.

\textbf{Exercise} write the code depicted on Figure Yyy in Python. Do
not forget to handle exceptional cases.

\textbf{Exercise} Write the main class and show that the method performs
a dynamic dispatch based on the classes.

\subsection{Indirection}\label{indirection}

Domain objects may end up being coupled to other objects in the first
iteration of your design. This principle states that you should create
an intermediate object that mediates between these two, hence reducing
coupling.

To the untrained eye, it may seem as if two objects that where coupled,
after applying the principle, are still coupled but to other object.
This reasoning is right, except that this indirection breaks the idea of
once object having a direct relation to the other one. The layer in
between breaks the coupling direction and creates a more flexible
design, since the two initially coupled objects do not need to know
anything about each other anymore.

An example of this pattern (Figure zzz) is the indirection introduced
between a guides and the images that belong to the guides. The idea here
is that the same guide is shared among friends and each one of them may
potentially see a different cover image. Prior to this principle, your
initial solution was to duplicate the guide for each friend and
recalculate the cover image for each of them. This solution is
redundant, consumes memory, and duplicates data, so an update on one
description involves updating all data in all copies of the guide. A
better solution is to add a new level of indirection between a guide and
its cover image, 'CoverManager`, that knows how to retrieve the best
cover image for the calling object. Internally, the manager may have to
call the AI algorithm from time to time to update the image, cache it if
the same user keeps coming to the same guide and even persist this
mapping of guide-cover image in the database if the cover image doesn't
change that often.

(Figure zzz)

\textbf{Exercise} Following the principles of these chapter, how would
you design data persistence of an object from the case study? That is,
would you add CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) methods to all
domain objects? If so, how would you avoid the coupling introduced by
this design?

\textbf{Exercise} How would you design the offline mode of your
application? That is, how do you deal with low connectivity or no
connectivity at all? Solution: you never assume that there is a
connection and instead create an intermediate layer that handles the
communication. If the server is unreachable, this layer handles how to
proceed. An advanced design pattern that users this idea is the circuit
breaker (explained in later chapters)

\subsection{Pure Fabrication}\label{pure-fabrication}

The term pure fabrication means to make something up. Use this principle
whenever you observe that your domain classes are getting too
overloaded, i.e., the start to exhibit high coupling and low cohesion.

The principle adds a new indirection between two objects that would
otherwise be directly connected (coupled). The indirection means adding
a new object that mediates the communication between two other entities.
This indirection object is not part of the domain and will be a made
software concept. Examples of this principle are: object pools, database
classes, and pretty much any object that sits in between two domain
objects. In terms of design patterns, this principle is observe in the
adapter pattern, shown in Figure xyz.

(Figure xyz)

Explain figure.

\textbf{Exercise}:Wwhere could this principle be applied in the case
study? Why? (There are many valid examples) Solution: the AI algorithm
that inject images to guides. If this was not there, every guide would
have the same image for all guides, tying the guide to the images. With
the algorithm, the same guide share with friends shows different images
based on other friends and connections. \textbf{Exercise}: let's assume
that you would like to add a notification system to the mobile app of
the case study whenever a friend posts a new comment on one of her
guides. What classes would you need to create? Solution: at the very
least, you would need a \texttt{Notification} class that contains the
text and image of the notification and some kind of notification manager
that schedules and send notifications to the appropriate parties.

\subsection{Protected Variation}\label{protected-variation}

This principle is easy to apply and, in practice, requires you to be
good at forecasting future pivot points or changes of direction.

The core idea of this principle is to shield your code in places where
you expect changes, let that be via interfaces or other means. For
example, if we were to provide special guides that users can buy, we
would need to integrate with a payment platform. If you are not sure
which one is best, you'll end up picking one and calling their methods
where necessary. However, what happens if you see that platform Z has
low commissions? You would want to change. ReFactoring may not be so
easy because both payment solutions have different libraries with
different API. So, you need to change all those specific calls by
whatever the new API and workflow mandates.

One way of solving this problem is via an interface and different
classes that implement those methods (Figure XYZ). In this design, you
are protecting yourself from future changes. Your concrete classes that
implement the interface maintain the workflow and your only job is to
create a new concrete class that implements your interface.

You should apply this pattern to instability points and, specially, when
using third party libraries that you don't have previous experience
with.

\subsection{Pure functions}\label{pure-functions}

This principle is not part of the common and well known GRASP principles
but, in my experience, you should consider it. Lambdas, closures and
pure functions are ubiquitous nowadays. My advice is that you stop using
closures that captures mutable state. The main reason is that, at one
point or another, you'll benchmark your application and start using
parallel capabilities of your computer: task, futures, actors or
whatever is the next parallel abstraction. If you encapsulate mutable
state in closures, you are building your own coffin for the not so far
away future. Things like processing an recognitive computation cannot be
used anymore if the object the closure captures is shared between two
threads -- unless you can guarantee data race freedom. Data race freedom
code is hard to write, maintain and make fast, so using locks may get
you out of troubles at the cost of losing horizontal scalability
