# Preface

The purpose of this book is to show how to write flexible and maintanable
code from a unique perspective: the type system of a language. For this reason, this book is
not a definitive guide to any language but a starting point to writing better software.
Using the type system (or lack thereof), you will experience the advantages and disadvantages
it brings to a language and perform an inform decision before you start hacking
on your next project. The examples are written in Java 8 and Python 3.4.

The first part of the book starts with a reminder of UML notation and basic concepts of object-oriented
programming. The second part explains each GRASP principle with examples from
a case study and compare and contrast the benefits and the approaches of each
language. The third part analyses real world, open source projects and localises
the points where GRASP principles have been used. In the last Part, you can
read the solution to the exercises proposed throughout the book.
