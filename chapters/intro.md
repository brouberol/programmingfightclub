# Introduction


<!-- The next section explains why writing code without a good design is -->
<!-- not a good solution in the long run and why you should never start -->
<!-- coding until you have a clear understanding of the problem and the -->
<!-- design choices available to you. -->

## Design

### What is a design?
### What is a design pattern?

Should I cover design patterns from ASD? YES

Should I cover UML? ... maybe not!

Introduction to other languages!

Design patterns:
- SOLID vs GRASP
- Design patterns for OOP and/or FP
- Testing to check that it works!
