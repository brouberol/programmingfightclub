# Static vs Dynamic language: GRASP Principles

This is the repo used for the ongoing book "Static vs Dynamic languages: GRASP principles".
It contains the text for the book, the command to build the website, images,
snippets of code, etc.

If you find an issue or have a recommendation on writing style (code and prose),
etc, please file an issue :)

# Build

The build system uses a `Makefile` to call `pandoc`.
On OS X, you can install `pandoc` by running: `brew install pandoc`.

# Contributions

This is the first time I write a book and I need as much help as I can get.
The content of the book is based on a course that I lecture on, in which
we cover UML, GRASP principles and the most common design patterns. For this reason,
the scope of the book will be limited to that, for now.

You are welcome to submit issues, fix typos via pull requests and/or give recommendations
on interesting examples, case studies or anything that you think can make this
book better.

The book will be licensed under CC-by-SA-4.0. It's free for reading online
and I will try to produce a good e-book, formatting mostly.
