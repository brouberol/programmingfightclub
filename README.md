### License

The book is open source under the [CC BY-SA](LICENSE) and the content is the same
for html, epub and softcover formats. You get better reading experience by buying
the book and support my work for maintanance and future releases (I have in
mind "Design patterns for the concurrent mind", depending on the experience of
publishing an introductory level book I may go for this other one afterwards).
