### GRASP principles for the Object-oriented Mind

This books covers GRASP principles from the type system's perspective.
We show the different aspects to consider when programming in a static and dynamic language.
For these purposes, we show examples using Java and Python, comment on what the type
system brings to an OOP perspective and show the benefits and drawbacks of these languages.
